# Paranasal Segmentation for Imaging-based Disease Evaluation

![logo](https://github.com/Hendrik-code/paraside/blob/main/images/logo.jpeg?raw=true)


This is the official repository of the paper "PARASIDE: An Automatic Paranasal Sinus Segmentation and Structure Analysis Tool for Magnetic Resonance Imaging"

PARASIDE enables the automated whole-paranasal sinus segmentation for T1-weighted MRI, extracting quantitative features that predict CRS severity accurately.
